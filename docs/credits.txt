CREDITS:

MatchDart is strongly inspired by M0nty's Cricket League Module.
I have made some heavy changes so nearly none of the original code is left
(exept for the admin functions)

Changes (incomplete):
1. The Module now uses the xoops smarty engine and template system
2. Some Cricket specific values have ben substituted by Dart specific ones
3. The Head-Head, Season and Event statistik have been dropped
(just because i have not enough time atm - they will be back in a future release)
4. The Players (teams) are no longer bound for one season/event

For the next release i will work mainly on a form to allow a xoops user
to add matches for a season/event if he is authorized to do so by the admin.
